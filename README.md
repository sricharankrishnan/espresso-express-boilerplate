## About
Espresso is an open source project, a web server scaffold built with Node/Express JS to help developers get a quick start in building web applications. Keeping in mind that express js is unopiniated and minimalistic in its approach to building web applications (thereby giving a free hand to developers), Espresso aims at being atleast a modest source of inspiration for developers, to adopt a structured approach to web development using javascript. This project comes with certain pre selected NPM pacakges reducing time to collect and assemble a basic web server.

Having to go through long hours thinking about assembling a web server for your next project might either be a daunting task for new developers or perhaps something that is repetitive & boring for experienced developers. If you know NodeJS and Express JS well, you'll be comfortable using espresso and the structure that it has to offer.
<br/><br/>

## Objectives
+ Provide a structured approach to Web Development
+ Reduce time to build and assemble a NodeJs Web Server for your next project
+ Standardized approach could offer advantages in the long run for company on boarding processes
+ Serve as a good starting point for developers to improve/enhance their web servers based on project requirements
+ Providing and enabling web application security by targetting what can be considered as 'Low Hanging Fruits'
<br/><br/>

## Built Using
+ [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/): Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser
+ [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/): Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.
+ [NPM Packages](https://www.npmjs.com/): npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language maintained by npm, Inc. npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js.
