![Espresso - The Express Boilerplate](https://github.com/sricharankrishnan/espresso-express-boilerplate/blob/master/shots/welcome-screen.gif?raw=true "Espresso - The Express Boilerplate")

## About
Espresso is an open source project that serves as a scaffold, to aid developers with a quick start in building web applications with node.js. The backend framework used in espresso is Express.js due to its minimalistic nature. This project comes with certain pre selected NPM pacakges reducing time to collect and assemble a node.js web server.

## Objectives
+ Structured and opiniated approach to web application developement with predefined folder structures and file naming conventions
+ Demonstrate use of open source technology from NPM for resolving application requirements like logging and application security
+ Connect web applications to Synk.io for monitoring and reducing security vulnerabilities of open source packages
+ Use helmet.js for web application security
+ Opt-in to ESLint for standardizing coding styles using the AirBnb Javascript Style Guide and write clean code
+ Reduce time to assemble a node.js web server for application development

## Built Using
The following are the highlights of the various packages and tools used for developing espresso. For reasons of brevity, only key technologies and package details are provided here. Checkout the package.json file for more information.
+ [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/): Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser
+ [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/): Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.
+ [Express HTTP to HTTPS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-http-to-https): is an express middleware that helps clients redirect from HTTP to HTTPs based request for secure transmission of data. This additionally helps improve application security inline with HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
+ [Helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet): a popular npm package for improving application security through HTTP security headers. 
+ [Rotating File Stream](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rotating-file-stream): an NPM package that helps create log files for applications baed on custom configurations like number of files, file size limit and log file naming pattern
+ [Integration with Synk.io](https://snyk.io/): a security platform that helps identify security vulnerabilities in NPM packages and also, performs code analysis of application source code.

## Feature Requests and Issues
If you would like to suggest a new feature or have an idea, please feel free to raise a good old Github Issue and I would do my best to have it done at the earliest possible. This project is open to receiving ideas, so your ideas and thoughts are welcome. Also, if there are issues that you've faced during the build process, highlight them as well with a GitHub Issue.

## Support Espresso
Supporting this project would go a long way in keeping me motivated to build other open source projects. If you like Espress and what it has to offer to the Web Dev community, support this project with a Github Star. Have a nice day ahead and Keep Coding!

<strong>You are free to download Espresso without any limitations. I would love to see this project structure being used for your project requirements! If this has made a difference to you, I'm really happy that I've contributed in a positive way.</strong>
